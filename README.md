# Feather-Client-API
An API that allows your server to detect &amp; interact with Feather Client

# NOTE
I actually started writing this before I realised that Feather had already made their own [FeatherServerAPI](https://github.com/FeatherMC/FeatherPlugin).  
Probably won't continue now that I know one already exists.

## TODO List
 - Add packets
 - Packet sending logic
 - Make separate plugin for server owners?
    - Include support for;
        - Waypoints
        - Kicking non Feather players
        - Checking mods
        - Listing players on Feather
        - Disabling 1.8 Hit Delay
